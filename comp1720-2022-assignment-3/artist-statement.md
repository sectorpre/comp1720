# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

What your interactive artwork is?

Audio and visual styles throughout history have both tried to capture emotions in their 
own unique way.
Many artists have even made efforts to connect the two, and you can almost hear tunes humming from works such as Blue Poles[2] by Jackson Pollock through their energetic brushstrokes or well-placed colours.
In my artwork, I want to bridge this gap further, and directly correlate sound and picture. 
Using a mathematical formula of calculating frequencies[1] based on angles, the image can be directly translated into a tune.

How interaction enhances the viewer's experience?

By itself, my artwork is simply lifeless functions that lie waiting for the 
user to interact with them.
As users add more points on the canvas, "bouncers" can then be released 
striking each node. 
This allows the user to broaden their perspectives on the visual and audio realms by directly experiencing the relation between sound and picture.
