What is my artwork?

The IJ7 is a bipedal, nuclear-powered mecha developed by the Australian Defence Force in 2054. Its weapon capabilities feature twin mounted turrets, a lazor cannon and 6 short-range missile launchers. The interface you will be interacting with is a declassified version of its operating system, allowing you to simply experience its weapon targeting system. To start, initialize the weapons systems(by pressing the enter key), select a weapon(with 1,2 or 3), fire (with f), and receive the accuracy of your shot.

Why is it an artwork?

Mechas have been an icon in pop culture since the 70s. We've seen them battle giant monsters, rampage around cities, and even fly through space. However, we seldom see beyond the shells of these titans to uncover their inner workings, components and systems. My interface gives users the opportunity to observe the subtle changes that take place in a mecha through selecting different types of weapons. My artwork was largely inspired by the GUI of evangelion[2] and missile components were referenced from the encyclopedia britannica[1].
