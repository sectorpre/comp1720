What my artwork is?

Adventurers beware!
Even after death, those who delve into the dark arts pose a threat to the unwary traveler.
Sensing the death of their host, evil spirits take control of the body, and these Husks stalk the lands attacking anyone
unlucky to encounter it.
The Husk's body stays completely still, suspended in mid-air, while it conjures a whirlwind of daggers which are controlled using 
the rotate(frameCount[1]/60.0) function.

Why my work is an artwork?

The Husk's aesthetic takes inspiration from cultist robes frequently depicted in fantasy games and RPGs[2].
Red typically symbolizes a form of untainted devotion towards a religion or idol[3]; in this case, it conveys the host's fanatical
lifestyle and its obsession with perfecting its evil arts.
Its arms are positioned folded together, completely concealing its body, and giving it an aura of mystery.
The daggers were created with curved hilts showing the wickedness of the subject matter.
